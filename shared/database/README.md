# Database Initialization Scripts

Place your database initialization scripts here:

- `auth_db/` - Scripts for authentication database
- `project_auction_db/` - Scripts for project/auction database
- `bidding_db/` - Scripts for bidding database

These can include:
- Initial data seeds
- Custom SQL scripts
- Database setup scripts

Note: Flyway migrations should be placed in each service's `src/main/resources/db/migration/` directory.
